# Day 6: Pane & Workflow

**Goal:** Develop spatial awareness by working with multiple editor panes and tabs.

### Tasks

1. Open `CompareA.kt` and `CompareB.kt` in separate panes side by side.
2. Compare the implementations of the `calculateScore` function in both files.
3. Navigate between panes using only keyboard shortcuts.
4. Make a change in `CompareB.kt` so that its `calculateScore` function matches the logic in `CompareA.kt`.
5. Close the `CompareA.kt` pane using only keyboard commands and then re‑open it.

### Stretch

Use a third pane to open `Occurrences.kt` from the previous drill and practise moving focus among three panes without losing track of your cursor.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- Do not drag tabs; use commands to split and move panes
