# Day 6: Pane & Workflow

**Goal:** Develop spatial awareness by working with multiple editor panes and tabs.

### Tasks

1. Open `CompareA.kt` and `CompareB.kt` in separate panes side by side (Command Palette: `Cmd-Shift-P`, run the split command labeled in your palette for a right split - often `Split Right` or `Pane: Split Right`, then `Cmd-P` to open the second file).
2. Compare the implementations of the `calculateScore` function in both files.
3. Navigate between panes using only keyboard shortcuts (Command Palette: `Cmd-Shift-P`, run the palette commands for `Focus Left`/`Focus Right` or `Next Pane`, and note the keybindings shown).
4. Make a change in `CompareB.kt` so that its `calculateScore` function matches the logic in `CompareA.kt`.
5. Close the `CompareA.kt` pane using only keyboard commands and then re-open it (Command Palette: `Cmd-Shift-P`, run the palette command shown as `Close Pane` or `Close Active Pane`, then split again and `Cmd-P`).

### Stretch

Use a third pane to open `Occurrences.kt` from the previous drill and practise moving focus among three panes without losing track of your cursor (Command Palette: `Cmd-Shift-P`, run the same right split command as above, then `Cmd-P`).

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- Do not drag tabs; use commands to split and move panes
