# Sanity Check
Hi, Eugene!

This folder contains a simple text file to verify that your development environment and Zed are configured correctly.

## Task

1. Open this file in Zed using the command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`).
2. Move the cursor to the first line using only keyboard shortcuts (`gg`).
3. Add a new line below the header with your name or a greeting (`o`, type, `Esc`).
4. Save the file using the keyboard (`Cmd-S`).

If you can complete these steps without using the mouse, your setup is ready for the more involved drills in the following folders.
