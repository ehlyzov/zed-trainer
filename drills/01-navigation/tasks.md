# Day 1: Navigation

**Goal:** Develop precise cursor movement without scrolling or using the mouse.

### Tasks

1. Open `LongFile.kt` in the `src` folder using the command palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`).
2. Move to line **200** without scrolling (Go to Line: `Cmd-G`, type `200`, `Enter`).
3. Jump between the `TODO` comments using search navigation (`/TODO`, `n` and `N`).
4. Open `ApiClient.kt` from the same folder using only the keyboard (File Finder: `Cmd-P`).
5. Switch back and forth between the two open files without using the mouse (File Finder: `Cmd-P`, type the file name, `Enter`).

### Stretch

Complete all of the above in under **10 minutes** without pausing longer than three seconds between commands.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- No scrolling with arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown
- No replace commands
