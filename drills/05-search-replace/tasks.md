# Day 5: Search & Replace

**Goal:** Use search to navigate and carefully replace text, focusing on accuracy over speed.

### Tasks

1. Open `Occurrences.kt`.
   - Search for the string `PLACEHOLDER` and count how many matches there are.
   - Replace the **second** occurrence only with `REPLACED`.
   - Undo the change and then replace **all** occurrences of `PLACEHOLDER` with `value` using a replace command with confirmation enabled.
2. Perform an in‑file search for the number `42` and navigate to each occurrence using keyboard shortcuts.
3. Use search in the Command Palette to find the action for “Find in Files” and note its keybinding.

### Stretch

Use a regular expression search (if supported in your environment) to find all numeric literals and wrap them in parentheses (e.g. `5` → `(5)`).  Perform replacements one at a time to avoid unintended matches.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- Do not rely solely on global replace; practise confirmation for each replacement
