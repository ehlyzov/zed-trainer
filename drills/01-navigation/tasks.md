# Day 1: Navigation

**Goal:** Develop precise cursor movement without scrolling or using the mouse.

### Tasks

1. Open `LongFile.kt` in the `src` folder using the command palette.
2. Move to line **200** without scrolling.  Use jump commands or the go‑to line feature.
3. Use keyboard shortcuts to jump between the `TODO` comments scattered throughout the file (there are six of them).  Visit each one at least once.
4. Open `ApiClient.kt` from the same folder using only the keyboard.
5. Switch back and forth between the two open files without using the mouse.

### Stretch

Complete all of the above in under **10 minutes** without pausing longer than three seconds between commands.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- No scrolling with arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown
- No search or replace commands — focus on navigation shortcuts only
