# Day 4: Multi‑Cursor Practice

**Goal:** Learn to add cursors above and below, select next occurrences and perform simultaneous edits.

### Tasks

1. Open `RenameMe.kt`.
   - Place the cursor on the first occurrence of `tempValue`.
   - Add cursors to the next two occurrences of `tempValue`.
   - Rename all three occurrences to `intermediate` in one go.
   - Use multi‑cursor navigation to insert a comment at the end of each renamed line.
2. Open `Constants.kt`.
   - Select the first occurrence of `PI_VALUE`.
   - Use the “select next occurrence” shortcut to add cursors to all remaining occurrences of `PI_VALUE`.
   - Rename them to `PI` simultaneously.

### Stretch

Use multi‑cursor editing to convert the list of numbers in `Constants.kt` into a list of strings (e.g. `1` → `"1"`) without leaving multi‑cursor mode.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- Avoid the global search/replace command; practise manual multi‑cursor selection
