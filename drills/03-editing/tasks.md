# Day 3: Editing and Structure

**Goal:** Practise editing operations such as duplicating, moving, deleting, joining and splitting lines without selecting text first.

### Tasks

1. Open `RefactorMe.kt`.
   - Duplicate the function `computeSum` and rename it to `computeSumCopy`.
   - Move the duplicated function below the `computeProduct` function.
   - Delete the commented `// unused` line.
2. Open `FormattingMe.kt`.
   - Join the lines in the `greeting` string so that the entire sentence sits on one line.
   - Split the long declaration of `numbers` into three separate lines, one number per line.
3. In both files, practise indenting and outdenting blocks using keyboard shortcuts only.

### Stretch

Refactor the helper functions into a separate `Utils` object (no need to create a new file; just practise cutting and pasting without using the mouse).

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- No selecting large regions manually — rely on line‑based operations
