# Day 2: Selection Mechanics

**Goal:** Practise selecting text at different granularities and manipulating selections without overshooting.

### Tasks

1. Open `messy_text.txt` in the `src` folder.
   - Select a single word.
   - Expand the selection to the whole line.
   - Shrink the selection back to the original word.
2. Open `NestedBlocks.kt`.
   - Select the innermost block of code inside the first function.
   - Expand the selection to include the surrounding function block.
   - Expand once more to select the entire class.
3. Cancel your selection without moving the cursor.
4. Select multiple adjacent lines and copy them, then paste them below using keyboard shortcuts only.

### Stretch

Perform all selection expansions and contractions smoothly without needing to read the menu or command palette.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- No free‑form dragging to select text
