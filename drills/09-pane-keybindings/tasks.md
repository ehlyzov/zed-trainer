# Day 9: Pane Keybindings (Zed)

**Goal:** Confirm your Zed pane keybindings and use them without the Command Palette.

### Tasks

1. Open `PaneOne.kt` (`Cmd-P`).
2. Use the Command Palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`) to locate these commands and note the keybindings shown in your daily notes:
   - Split Right
   - Split Down
   - Focus Left/Right/Up/Down
   - Next Pane
   - Close Pane
   - Close Other Panes
3. Use your split keybindings (not the palette) to create a three-pane layout and open `PaneTwo.kt` and `PaneThree.kt`.
4. Navigate between panes using only the focus/next-pane keybindings. Do three full cycles without getting lost.
5. Close the rightmost pane with the close-pane keybinding, then reopen it and `PaneTwo.kt`.
6. Return to a single pane using the close-other-panes keybinding.

### Stretch

Repeat steps 3-6 without pausing more than three seconds between pane commands.

### Forbidden

- No mouse or trackpad
- No Command Palette after step 2
